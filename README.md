Extreme learning machine is an emerging neural network architecture that offers fast learning
and generalization for multiple tasks. Compared with the other conventional network algorithm it
has the advantage of over fitting problems and slow training speed. In this work to detect images
and to validate the model, MNIST database that is collected from kaggle is used which is widely
employed in the neural network architectures and for image classification in discetre machine
learning models. Feature extraction using convolutional neural networks is performed on a
sample image.

Pipeline design

Extreme Learning Machine:
Any activation function can be used, ReLU and sigmoid are used in this project.
The accuracy of the model came out to be 93.4%.

Feature mapping:
Extracted feature and mapped different layers with 1-D convolution neural network.
For data, an image of a cat in png format is used.
After loading the image through OpenCV, different layers were mapped.
Feature extraction after applying different layers:
